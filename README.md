# Third Eye

This project is the software component from the full end 2 end House Monitoring System called **Third-Eye**.

It can:
- analyse a scene 
- perform motion detection & object detection
- collect data and show useful statistics
- trigger security alerts to home-owners when it's required

Yes, there are plenty of repos and ready-to-use projects like this out there, but it's fun to build you own one,
with the additional benefit of understanding what's going on under the hood, and full control.

## Hardware (TODO)

Let's talk hardware, shall we?

WIP ... To be continued ...

## Installation (TODO):

- Virtual env
- Crontab
- TODO
- Supervisor

## Scripts in the repo (TODO)

## Bonus: Overclocking Rpi:

It is possible to give RPi a little boost, but do it at your risk.

See this great [article](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/how-to-overclock-raspberry-pi-4) for more info on
that, and monitor your CPU temperature to avoid a nasty Cowabunga!
